	<h1>Nitya Buch: All about me</h1><h2>my biography</h2>
	<p>My name is Nitya and I was born and raised in India. I love to sketch, doodle, watch movies and tv show, play tons of sports, procrastinate on my homework projects and win mental argumens. I am a professional bathroom singer and my dream is to have an overthing-brain-damage-syndrome named after me. My life revolves around my friends and I will never be not thankful to them for everything they have done for me so far in my life.
